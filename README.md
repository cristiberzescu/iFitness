# iFitness

For my bachelor's thesis, I developed a fitness mobile application that:
- provides users with the ability to track their calorie intake
- view fitness exercises for proper execution, and injury prevention
- Users can create their own personalized workouts based on their preferences, where they can add exercises, sets, weights, and repetitions for each exercise.
  
The application also includes a dedicated measurement page where users can input measurements for different body parts, including weight and height. This functionality aids in monitoring and tracking progress, ensuring users stay on the right track towards achieving their goals. Additionally, there is a dedicated map page where users can explore and find nearby fitness facilities for training purposes.

The code was written in Kotlin programming language using Android Studio and for data storage I used:
- Firebase Realtime Database - a NoSQL database where all the data about users and their information were saved
- Firebase Store - an Object Storage used to save the training videos displayed in the application
